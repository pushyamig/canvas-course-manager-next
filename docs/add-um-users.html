<h1 class="mt-5">Add U-M Users</h1>
<p>Bulk adding U-M users to course sections with Canvas Course Manager is an administrator feature that offers some benefits over the People tool method:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can add users from a CSV file.</li>
  <li>You can create a section on the fly and add users to it.</li>
  <li>You can add users to multiple preexisting sections at one time.</li>
  <li>Prevent Canvas course invitation messages and email notifications from being sent to new course members.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h5">Who Can Add U-M users</h2>
<p>Bulk adding U-M users to sections is limited to Canvas administrator roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Root Account Administrator</li>
  <li>Sub-Account Administrator</li>
  <li>Support Consultant</li>
  <li>Teachers and other course managers can request assistance by contacting <a href="mailto:4help@umich.edu">4help@umich.edu</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Tip:</b> Instructors and other roles with People tool access can add U-M users in bulk by entering a list of email addresses or Uniqnames (login ID) in the People tool. 
  Note that users added this way may receive a new course invitation message from Canvas.
</p>
<h2 class="h5">How to Add U-M Users to a Single Section</h2>

  <li>Prepare and save your CSV file following the onscreen instructions for header and row content.</li>

</ol>
<h2 class="h5">How to Add U-M Users to Multiple Sections</h2>
<p>
  This feature allows administrators to add U-M users to more than one existing section at the same time. 
  Users are not required to have the same role. New sections cannot be created with this tool.
</p>

  A list of course section IDs is included with this tool to help with CSV file preparation.
