<h1 class="mt-5">Add U-M Users</h1>
<p>Bulk adding U-M users to course sections with Course Manager is an administrator feature that offers some benefits over the People tool method:</p>
<ul class="mx-3">
  <li>Add users from a CSV file</li>
  <li>Create a section on the fly and add users to it</li>
  <li>Add users to multiple existing sections at one time</li>
  <li>Bypasses the built-in Canvas People tool email notifications sent to new course members</li>
</ul>
<h5>Who Can Add U-M users?</h5>
<p>Bulk adding U-M users to sections is limited to Canvas administrator roles:</p>
<ul class="mx-3">
  <li>Root Account Administrator</li>
  <li>Sub-Account Administrator</li>
  <li>Support Consultant</li>
  <li>Teachers and other course managers can request additional assistance by contacting <a href="mailto:4help@umich.edu">4help@umich.edu</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tip: </b>Instructors and other roles with People tool access can add U-M users in bulk by entering a list of email addresses or Uniqunames (login ID) in the People tool, being aware that the users may receive a new course invitation message from Canvas.</p>
<h5>How to Add U-M Users to a Single Section?</h5>
<p>This feature allows administrators to select an existing section or create a new section to accept the users.</p>
<ul class="list-group-numbered">
  <li>Click the Add U-M users button in Canvas Course Manager.</li>
  <li>Choose the “1 Section at a Time” option and click Select.</li>
  <li>Download the example CSV file, if needed.</li>
  <li>Prepare and save your CSV file following the onscreen instructions for header and row content.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop, or click the link to upload your saved CSV file.</li>
  <li>CSV file data is presented back to you. Verify the results and click Submit.</li>
</ul>
<h5>How to Add U-M Users to Multiple Sections?</h5>
<p>This feature allows administrators to add U-M users to more than one existing section at the same time. New sections cannot be created with this tool.</p>
<p>To use this feature you must include the Canvas section ID (not the section SIS ID) in your CSV file. A list of course section ID is included with this tool to help with CSV file preparation. </p>
