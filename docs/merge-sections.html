<h1 class="mt-5">Merge Sections</h1>
<p>
  Merge Sections makes it quick and easy to combine sections from multiple Canvas courses in the same term into a single course. 
  For example, an instructor may want to combine lab/discussion sections with the lecture section(s) into a single course for a specific term.
